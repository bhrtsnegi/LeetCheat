delivery_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Delivery)*100 ,2) AS immediate_percentage 
FROM Delivery
WHERE order_date=customer_pref_delivery_date;
